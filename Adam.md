# Crash Course Lecture Notes on Test-Driven Development (TDD) for Dummies

## Introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## What is Test-Driven Development?

•	Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development technique that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code.

## Why TDD?

•	TDD helps ensure code quality.
•	It encourages a more iterative and focused development process.
•	It helps easier code maintenance and refactoring.
•	TDD can lead to better design and reduced debugging time.
The TDD Process
The Three Phases of TDD
1.	Red: Write a failing test
•	Start by writing a test that checks a specific functionality.
•	Since you have not implemented the feature yet, the test should fail.
2.	Green: Write the minimum code to pass the test
•	Write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass.
•	Avoid writing extra functionality at this stage.
3.	Refactor: Improve the code
•	Refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, and performance.
•	Ensure all tests still pass.
The TDD Cycle
•	Repeatedly go through the three phases: Red, Green, and Refactor.
•	The cycle helps you iteratively build and improve your code.
Writing Good Tests
Characteristics of Good Tests
•	Isolated: Tests should not depend on external factors or earlier tests.
•	Repeatable: Tests should produce the same results every time.
•	Fast: Tests should sprint to help frequent testing.
•	Clear and Readable: Tests should be easy to understand.
Writing Test Cases
•	Find specific test cases to cover different scenarios.
•	Use descriptive test names to clarify the test’s purpose.
•	Include assertions to check expected outcomes.
