Benefits of TDD:
Code Reliability: TDD helps catch and fix issues early, reducing bugs in the final product.
Improved Design: TDD encourages modular and well-structured code.
Documentation: Tests serve as living documentation for how the code should work.
Safety Net: Provides a safety net for code changes, allowing you to confidently make improvements.
Faster Debugging: When a test fails, it's easier to identify and fix the problem.

```// Green Phase: Write minimal code to pass the test
public class Calculator {
    public int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }
}```
